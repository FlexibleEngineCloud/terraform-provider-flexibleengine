# Data Source: flexibleengine_vpc_subnet_v1

`flexibleengine_vpc_subnet_v1` provides details about a specific VPC subnet.

This resource can prove useful when a module accepts a subnet id as
an input variable and needs to, for example, determine the id of the
VPC that the subnet belongs to.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "flexibleengine_vpc_subnet_v1" "subnet_v1" {
  id   = "${var.subnet_id}"
 }

output "subnet_vpc_id" {
  value = "${data.flexibleengine_vpc_subnet_v1.subnet_v1.vpc_id}"
}
```
