# flexibleengine_vpc_v1

flexibleengine_vpc_v1 provides details about a specific VPC.

This resource can prove useful when a module accepts a vpc id as an input variable and needs to, for example, determine the CIDR block of that VPC.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how one might accept a VPC id as a variable and use this data source to obtain the data necessary to create a subnet within it.

```hcl

variable "vpc_name" {}

data "flexibleengine_vpc_v1" "vpc" {
  name = "${var.vpc_name}"
}

```

## Argument Reference

The arguments of this data source act as filters for querying the available VPCs in the current region. The given filters must match exactly one VPC whose data will be exported as attributes.

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V1 VPC client. A VPC client is needed to retrieve VPCs. If omitted, the region argument of the provider is used.

* `id` - (Optional) The id of the specific VPC to retrieve.
