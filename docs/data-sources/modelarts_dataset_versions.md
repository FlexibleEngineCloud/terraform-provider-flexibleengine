# flexibleengine_modelarts_dataset_versions

Use this data source to get a list of ModelArts dataset versions.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "dataset_id" {}
data "flexibleengine_modelarts_dataset_versions" "test" {
  dataset_id = var.dataset_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The arguments of this data source act as filters for querying the available dataset versions in the current region.
All dataset versions that meet the filter criteria will be exported as attributes.

* `region` - (Optional, String) Specifies the region in which to obtain dataset versions. If omitted, the
provider-level region will be used.

* `dataset_id` - (Required, String) Specifies the ID of dataset.

* `split_ratio` - (Optional, String) Specifies the range of splitting ratio which randomly divides a labeled sample
into a training set and a validation set. Separate the minimum and maximum split ratios with commas,
for example: "0.0,1.0".

* `name` - (Optional, String) Specifies the name of the dataset version.
