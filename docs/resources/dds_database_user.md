variable "owned_role_db_name" {}

resource "flexibleengine_dds_database_user" "test" {
  instance_id = var.instance_id

  name     = var.user_name
  password = var.user_password
  db_name  = var.db_name

  roles {
    name    = var.owned_role_name
    db_name = var.owned_role_db_name
  }
}
```

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The resource ID.

* `privileges` - The list of database privileges owned by the current user.
  The [object](#dds_database_privileges) structure is documented below.

* `inherited_privileges` - The list of database privileges owned by the current user, includes all privileges
  inherited by owned roles. The [object](#dds_database_privileges) structure is documented below.

<a name="dds_database_privileges"></a>

* `resources` - The details of the resource to which the privilege belongs.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following timeouts configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 2 minute.
* `update` - Default is 2 minute.
* `delete` - Default is 2 minute.

## Import

Database users can be imported using their `id` (combination of `instance_id`, `db_name` and `name`), separated by a
slash (/), e.g.

```
terraform import flexibleengine_dds_database_user.test <instance_id>/<db_name>/<name>
```

Due to security reason, the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition (`password` parameter).
It is generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing a user resource.
You can then decide if changes should be applied to the user, or the resource definition should be updated to align with
the user. Also you can ignore changes as below.

```hcl
resource "flexibleengine_dds_database_user" "test" {
  ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      password,
    ]
  }
}
```
