Using this resource to manage the instance routes within FlexibleEngine.

## Example Usage

variable "instance_id" {}

resource "flexibleengine_apig_instance_routes" "test" {
  instance_id = var.instance_id
  nexthops    = ["172.16.3.0/24", "172.16.7.0/24"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region where the dedicated instance and routes are located.  
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this will create a new resource.

  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `nexthops` - (Required, List) Specifies the configuration of the next-hop routes.

-> The network segment of the next hop cannot overlap with the network segment of the APIG instance.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The resource ID (instance ID).

## Import

Routes can be imported using their related dedicated instance ID (`instance_id`), e.g.

```bash
terraform import flexibleengine_apig_instance_routes.test 128001b3c5eb4d3e91a8da9c0f46420f
