# flexibleengine\_ces\_alarmrule

Manages a Cloud Eye alarm rule resource within FlexibleEngine.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "flexibleengine_ces_alarmrule" "alarm_rule" {
  alarm_name = "alarm_rule"

  metric {
    namespace   = "SYS.ECS"
    metric_name = "network_outgoing_bytes_rate_inband"
    dimensions {
        name  = "instance_id"
        value = var.instance_id
    }
  }
  condition  {
    period              = 300
    filter              = "average"
    comparison_operator = ">"
    value               = 6
    unit                = "B/s"
    count               = 1
  }
  alarm_actions {
    type = "notification"
    notification_list = [
      var.topic_id
    ]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `alarm_name` - (Required, String) Specifies the name of an alarm rule. The value can
    be a string of 1 to 128 characters that can consist of numbers, lowercase letters,
    uppercase letters, underscores (_), or hyphens (-).

* `metric` - (Required, List) Specifies the alarm metrics. The structure is described
    below.

* `condition` - (Required, List) Specifies the alarm triggering condition. The structure
    is described below.

* `alarm_description` - (Optional, String) The value can be a string of 0 to 256 characters.

* `alarm_enabled` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether to enable the alarm. The default
    value is true.

* `alarm_level` - (Optional, Int, ForceNew) Specifies the alarm severity. The value can be
    1, 2, 3 or 4, which indicates *critical*, *major*, *minor*, and *informational*, respectively.
    The default value is 2. Changing this creates a new resource.

* `alarm_actions` - (Optional, List) Specifies the action triggered by an alarm. The
    structure is described below.

* `ok_actions` - (Optional, List) Specifies the action triggered by the clearing of
    an alarm. The structure is described below.

* `alarm_action_enabled` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether to enable the action
    to be triggered by an alarm. The default value is true.

    -> **Note** If alarm_action_enabled is set to true, either alarm_actions or
    ok_actions cannot be empty. If alarm_actions and ok_actions coexist, their
    corresponding notification_list must be of the same value.

The `metric` block supports:

* `namespace` - (Required, String) Specifies the namespace in **service.item** format.
    service.item can be a string of 3 to 32 characters that must start with a letter and
    can consists of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or underscores (_).
    For details, see [Services Interconnected with Cloud Eye](https://docs.prod-cloud-ocb.orange-business.com/en-us/api/ces/ces_03_0059.html).

* `metric_name` - (Required, String) Specifies the metric name. The value can be a string
    of 1 to 64 characters that must start with a letter and can consists of uppercase
    letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or underscores (_).

* `dimensions` - (Required, List) Specifies the list of metric dimensions. Currently,
    the maximum length of the dimesion list that are supported is 3. The structure
    is described below.

The `dimensions` block supports:

* `name` - (Required, String) Specifies the dimension name. The value can be a string
    of 1 to 32 characters that must start with a letter and can consists of uppercase
    letters, lowercase letters, numbers, underscores (_), or hyphens (-).

* `value` - (Required, String) Specifies the dimension value. The value can be a string
    of 1 to 64 characters that must start with a letter or a number and can consists
    of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, underscores (_), or hyphens
    (-).

The `condition` block supports:

* `period` - (Required, Int) Specifies the alarm checking period in seconds. The
    value can be 1, 300, 1200, 3600, 14400, and 86400.
    Note: If period is set to 1, the raw metric data is used to determine
    whether to generate an alarm.

* `filter` - (Required, String) Specifies the data rollup methods. The value can be
    max, min, average, sum, and vaiance.

* `comparison_operator` - (Required, String) Specifies the comparison condition of alarm
    thresholds. The value can be >, =, <, >=, or <=.

* `value` - (Required, String) Specifies the alarm threshold. The value ranges from
    0 to Number of 1.7976931348623157e+308.

* `count` - (Required, Int) Specifies the number of consecutive occurrence times.
    The value ranges from 1 to 5.

* `unit` - (Optional, String) Specifies the data unit.

the `alarm_actions` block supports:

* `type` - (Optional, String) specifies the type of action triggered by an alarm. the
    value can be *notification* or *autoscaling*.
    - notification: indicates that a notification will be sent to the user.
    - autoscaling: indicates that a scaling action will be triggered.

* `notification_list` - (Optional, List) specifies the list of objects to be notified
    if the alarm status changes, the maximum length is 5.
    if type is set to *notification*, the value of notification_list cannot be empty.
    if type is set to *autoscaling*, the value of notification_list must be **[]**
    and the value of namespace must be *SYS.AS*.
    Note: to enable the autoscaling alarm rules take effect, you must bind scaling
    policies.

the `ok_actions` block supports:

* `type` - (Optional, String) specifies the type of action triggered by an alarm. the
    value is notification.
    notification: indicates that a notification will be sent to the user.

* `notification_list` - (Optional, List) specifies the list of objects to be notified
    if the alarm status changes, the maximum length is 5.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Indicates the alarm rule ID.

* `alarm_state` - Indicates the alarm status. The value can be:
    - ok: The alarm status is normal;
    - alarm: An alarm is generated;
    - insufficient_data: The required data is insufficient.

* `update_time` - Indicates the time when the alarm status changed.
    The value is a UNIX timestamp and the unit is ms.

## Import

CES alarm rules can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import flexibleengine_ces_alarmrule.alarm_rule al1619678242900OxEaaODM2
```
