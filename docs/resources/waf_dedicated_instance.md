variable subnet_id {}
variable security_group_id {}

resource "flexibleengine_waf_dedicated_instance" "instance_1" {
  name               = "instance_1"
  available_zone     = var.az_name
  specification_code = "waf.instance.professional"
  ecs_flavor         = var.ecs_flavor_id
  vpc_id             = var.vpc_id
  subnet_id          = var.subnet_id

  security_group = [
    var.security_group_id
  ]
