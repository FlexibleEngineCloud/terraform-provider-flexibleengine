Manages an APIG (API) custom response resource within Flexibleengine.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "instance_id" {}
variable "group_id" {}
variable "response_name" {}

resource "flexibleengine_apig_response" "test" {
  name        = var.response_name
  instance_id = var.instance_id
  group_id    = var.group_id

  rule {
    error_type  = "AUTHORIZER_FAILURE"
    body        = "{\"code\":\"$context.authorizer.frontend.code\",\"message\":\"$context.authorizer.frontend.message\"}"
    status_code = 401
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region in which to create the API custom response resource. If
  omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this will create a new API custom response resource.

* `group_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of the API group to which the API response belongs to.
  Changing this will create a new API custom response resource.

* `instance_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of the APIG dedicated instance to which the API group
  where the API custom response belongs. Changing this will create a new API custom response resource.

* `name` - (Required, String) Specifies the name of the API custom response. The name consists of 1 to 64 characters,
  and only letters, digits, hyphens(-), and underscores (_) are allowed.

* `id` - ID of the API custom response.
* `create_at` - Time when the API custom response is created.
* `update_at` - Time when the API custom response was last modified.

## Import

API Responses can be imported using the ID of the APIG dedicated instances and API groups to which the API
response belongs and API Response `name`, separated by a slash, e.g.

```shell
terraform import flexibleengine_apig_response.test <instance_id>/<group_id>/<name>
```
