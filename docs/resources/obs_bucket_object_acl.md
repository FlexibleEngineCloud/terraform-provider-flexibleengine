# flexibleengine_obs_bucket_object_acl

Manages an OBS bucket object acl resource within FlexibleEngine.

-> **NOTE:** When creating or updating the OBS bucket object acl, the original object acl will be overwritten. When
deleting the OBS bucket object acl, only the owner permissions will be retained, and the other permissions will be
removed.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "bucket" {}
variable "key" {}
variable "account1" {}
variable "account2" {}

resource "flexibleengine_obs_bucket_object_acl" "test" {
  bucket = var.bucket
  key    = var.key

  account_permission {
    access_to_object = ["READ"]
    access_to_acl    = ["READ_ACP", "WRITE_ACP"]
    account_id       = var.account1
  }

  account_permission {
    access_to_object = ["READ"]
    access_to_acl    = ["READ_ACP"]
    account_id       = var.account2
  }

  public_permission {
    access_to_acl = ["READ_ACP", "WRITE_ACP"]
  }
}
```
